        Craft Beer is a muddy-trucking miracle, the polar opposite of corporate, mass produced swill.
        Free the Beers exists to defy and destroy the corporate strangle hold of Big Beer.  We strive to educate people as conscious consumers who are willing to "vote with their feet(aka dollars)."  We are basically an anti-trust movement seeking to change the way that beer specificaly is regulated.  We seek to make a more competitive environment for craft beer, so that it can compete based on its own merits.

                    Glorius metriocratic capitalism needs the guidance of woke citizens.  If you aren't already voting and actively particapting in our democracy, this is as good of a reason as any!  When you don't vote, the terrorists win.  Red and blue states can, and should unite over tasty, small batch beer!  We can heal the polarization of this country through better beer.
